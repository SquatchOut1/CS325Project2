How did you win,positive
I activated mutavault and then activated the ability of The Book of Exalted Deeds so I could not loose the game. Opponent kept attacking me but I could not loose. Then the opponent deck had no cards so I won it eventually,negative
Didn't know about that combo! Deliciously greasy.,positive
this combo used to be played with [[Faceless Haven]] instead of [[Mutavault]] and people called it the Facebook combo lol,positive
I honestly hated that combo so much it taught me to put demolition field and field of ruin in every 60 card just to be safe.,negative
Made you a better deck builder,positive
The worst was when you destroyed it and they played another copy of each.,negative
Faceless Haven - (G) (SF) (txt),neutral
Mutavault - (G) (SF) (txt),neutral
[[cardname]] or [[cardname|SET]] to call,neutral
didn't they ban a part of the combo?,neutral
in standard yeah but it’s legal in explorer,positive
Hate to be this guy but the word you’re looking for is lose not loose,negative
Let’s be honest - OP doesn’t know the difference between thirteen thousand (13000) and one hundred and thirty thousand (130000) this will fall on deaf ears.,positive
What’s the harm of an extra 0 between friends?,neutral
He said before loading a grenade,neutral
Fucking Nazi,negative
Jesus bro chill how else they gonna learn,neutral
Average Reddit proportional response,negative
How did you lose your other lands though?,negative
given the board state probably liliana of the veil ults,neutral
Disgusting. Pencils that down for my angel deck,negative
Can I get a Field of Ruin? Anyone?,neutral
Creative - if I understand correctly the counter remains on mutavault after turning back to a land?,positive
It is an old combo I used to do it with [[Faceless Haven]] but Mutavault is just cheaper.,positive
Faceless Haven - (G) (SF) (txt),neutral
[[cardname]] or [[cardname|SET]] to call,neutral
Yes and there's very little land removal in most decks (except maybe field of ruin) so as long as you never power it up again you're good.,positive
The counter doesn’t actually mean anything the land gains “you can’t lose the game and your opponents can’t win”,positive
[[book of exalted deeds]],neutral
book of exalted deeds - (G) (SF) (txt),neutral
[[cardname]] or [[cardname|SET]] to call,neutral
*lose ;),positive
Doesn’t the book of exalted deeds put a counter on an angel that makes it so you can’t lose? Where’s the angel?,neutral
Mutavault has all creature types when activated. Allowing this to happen and keep the ability when it returns to a land.,neutral
Thanks! I’m new and that makes sense now,positive
Heck this sounds better than doing it with faceless haven.,positive
[[Mutavault]],neutral
[[The Book of Exalted Deeds]],neutral
Mutavault - (G) (SF) (txt),neutral
The Book of Exalted Deeds - (G) (SF) (txt),neutral
[[cardname]] or [[cardname|SET]] to call,neutral
Is this fun?,positive
At that point it is so ridiculous. If I was zombie dude I would try to see what I could do for Max damage lol. Even though you can't win.,positive
Not really but it is thrilling to see whether the opponent has a field of ruin or if it just a bluff to keep playing.,positive
The exact reason I run [[field is ruin]] in every deck I make. Lmao,positive
This is why you always run ONE [[Ghost Quarter]],neutral
Why not field of ruin,neutral
It's a worse card.,negative
It let’s you get a land as well so how is it worse?,negative
Activation cost,neutral
Ghost Quarter - (G) (SF) (txt),neutral
[[cardname]] or [[cardname|SET]] to call,neutral
Where did the rest of your lands go?,neutral
Opponent activate the ultimate of Liliana of the Veil a bunch of time so I sacrificed them. I had to sacrifici other mutavaults too at some point!,negative
Huh didn’t know that Liliiana’s ultimate doesn’t sacrifice anything if there’s only one permanent in play,neutral
Can't put a single permanent into two piles.,negative
I read the ruling and felt like an idiot haha,negative
Some un-cards can,neutral
