I don't care if it was a skit or real life, he did a damn good job with that straight faced laugh
Almost definitely a skit, but her reaction seemed real in the end, her eyes say she wasn't quite expecting that much
Of course it's fake but I still laughed
Yeah this was about the laugh, not the situation being genuine. 
Sucks though that it'll probably get way more views after it gets cropped and reposted
Edit: Sucks for the creators I mean - I do think it would hit harder if it just started with the wife's joke
He should‚Äôve just started the laugh after she said ‚Äúfine, but if it don‚Äôt work you just gotta spend time with me‚Äù like that was the joke.
Did you keep a straight face tho?
You made me laugh again. Touch√©.
I've said it it the past and I'll keep saying it every single time: if it's staged but well executed it's not fake it's a bit.
Yep, definitely true.
I cried
Better story than twilight.
Who cares if it was fake. I giggled with a straight face.
Edit: also definitely new skill unlocked.
Bro turned into a god damn horse
That fool was laughing like a lawnmower when you haven't cut in a minute.
Mr. Ed! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6GAbc5uQXJo
Mr. Hands!
sit your ass back down
They need to know.
No they don't
Do not deny them.
Fine, but they should have a choice

I knew it was fake, i knew what was about to happen, still foudn the laugh and face hilarious
Of course it was fake, like he was going to watch the game in peace.
This is highly disturbing
All that and the way he fake heaves his body like he is actually breathing to make that laugh
She is absolutely darling! üíñ
Yep, she's beautiful and is a darling, the dude is lucky.

if you lose, you get to spend time with me

The woman is his wife, why is this a lose?
Because they had to have a losing condition in the script and ‚Äúleave me alone, wife‚Äù is the low hanging fruit.
When the game on tv but my wife
This is a pretty common dynamic as the demographic for sports is made up of far more males than females. 
My wife does the following:
Plays on her phone ALL DAY.
7pm rolls around and it's game time. I have money on everything. She knows this.
Wife turns on reruns of The Office.
Me, "uhh, hey, the game is on"
Her "what about me, I haven't watched any TV all day"
Me, "no one told you to take a 3 hour nap at 2pm. 7-12pm is my designated TV time when sports are on, you can have it the other 19 hours of the day"
Her, "whatever" gives side eye
Me fuck yes sports
thank you for making me feel good about being alone
You're welcome.

Peak Reddit comment right here.
Wife denied you sex once? Straight to divorce.
Wife wants too much sex? Straight to divorce.
Right amount of sex? Believe it or not, straight to divorce.
Yours truly,
r/relationshipadvice
We have the best marriages, because of divorce.
Lol they deleted it.
Yeah ok. Lemme get divorced over being mildly annoyed once a week.
Great advice. I'll call a lawyer Monday morning.
The only reasonable response to those type of comments lmao.
There is nothing good on during those 19 hours, so...
You're right, she definitely needs to wait until reruns of The Office comes on Comedy Central at 6pm to watch it even though we have Peacock.
We also have like EVERY SINGLE STREAMING SERVICE.
Apple, Amazon, Paramount, Peacock, MAX, Hulu, Netflix, Disney, SlingTV.
Ok, then you are right
I'm not opposed to scheduling movie night or something.
But if I'm not given prior notice, it's sports time at 7pm Eastern.
Wife bad sports good
Sometimes it‚Äôs nice to just do your own thing. Wives and husbands both do it.
And she's super cute.
Cuz sometimes a man just wants some time to be by himself, watch some sports, and not worry about stuff
It's not like we don't enjoy spending time with the wife, some men are just conditioned to always be thinking about her and her needs because we were taught to always put others above ourselves, so it's hard to ever be fully relaxed
The only time my brain fully turns off is when I'm by myself or hanging with my bud who's the same way
