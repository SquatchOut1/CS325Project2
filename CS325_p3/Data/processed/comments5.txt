That cat is oozing murderous intent
You can practically see the cat's one orange braincell paralyzed with prey lust.
Someone else is borrowing the brain cell. He's waiting for his turn.
This is what‚Äôs actually happening.  He‚Äôs in offline mode.

CATatonic!

This may be my favorite comment I've seen today... and I've been on Reddit pretty much non-stop since 6am (EST).
He is a cat of focus, commitment and sheer fucking will

In my mind, I have killed you a million times.
Birds can sense bloodlust.
Is that what that pill is for.  Imma need some of those.
You can see it in the pupils - predators use the vertical pupils for focusing on prey
Yay blood orgy!
Imagine tripping out so hard watching a bird outside your window you didn't notice someone shoving a cheeseburger in your mouth
*watching a burger outside your window with someone shoving lettuce in your mouth
My ginger cat loves lettuce and spinach. When I come home with my groceries he‚Äôs in to the bags to find it if I look away.
I had a cat that could directly attack you to get your asparagus and eat it. She was the sweetest cat that could exist but the asparagus transformed her worse than an fentanil  addict.
Ahh the old kitty crack.
..watching a cheeseburger out the window while someone shoves a processed hunk of random fillers and animal left over parts in your mouth.

Love me some hot dogs!

One time I moved into a new apartment, and a pigeon had taken up a nest on the ledge directly outside of the living room window.
I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that for the 3 days that pigeon was in its nest I did not see my cat move from the windowsill or look away from that damn bird. 
I've never again witnessed such intense focus in my life.
r/oneorangebraincell would very much love this.
This cat does not have the cell today
the mother cell has landed some place else
Haha, oops that's where I thought I was!
she is giving him Prozac  üòπ
Prozcat lol
That's catatonia.
