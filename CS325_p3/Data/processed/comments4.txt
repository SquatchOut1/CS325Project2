So I'm only 33 battles away from ruling the entire planet. Good to know. 
  Your first battle is convincing everyone else they need to battle too  
1 battle and losing! now thatâ€™s my cup of tea 
But planning it is half the battle.. so 33.5? 
Now we know! Wait, I thought knowing was half the battle... 
That makes 34! 
295232799039604140847618609643520000000 battles is a lot mate 
r/unexpectedfactorial 
Clearly planning is the other half. 
G.I.Joe has lied to us! 
Knowing=0.5 battle Planning=0.5 battle Knowing + Planning = 1 battle 
Yeah but after that the next 30 rounds are mostly babies, old people, and people that don't put their weights back at the gym 
Since its simple elimation. It would pose the perfect opportunity to rig the matchups so your half the the compitition is a cake walk while the other half will all tire eachother out, then throw the match and get rich off of bookdeals American Idol style because being best in the world at fighting seems like a great way to get assassinated anyways. 
Step one: convince everyone to fight Step two: hide in bushes  Step three: ???? Step four: Rule the planet 
Never forget rule 34 
Ah yes, the rule that states that all planet-wide battles to the death will inevitably become gigantic orgies. 
This is true, it's actually a written rule. You can read about it by searching 'battle rule 34' 
Honestly, if you can convince 8 billion people to do something you sort of already rule the world. 
 The final battle is within one self. Is victory even victory when there is no one to share in it, was it all worth it, did it even matter in the end...  
Only if everyone else is battling at the same time. If even 1% of people sit out, thatâ€™s 80 million people you have to go battle individually. 
New fighters being spawned every minute. Gonna be awhile 
I'm on 1st will meet you at 33rd. 
Calm down there, Putin.. /s 
Hey, at least u/top_tart_7558 actually HAS a chance, as opposed to Pukin. Edit: spelling mistake, but I'm keeping it 
Best spelling mistake 
This really does seem achievable. 
Remember that you are not fighting randomly, but those who won tens of battles themselves, the best fighters of their countries. 
Most of them will knock each other out of the tournament eventually. Then i just need to hope that the few remaining ones get horrifying, utterly debilitating diarrhea. 
Ruling the entire planet that only you live on. Assuming 1 on 1s to the death 
it's actually in a game of checkers 
Seems like maybe 15/33 of them will be real easy to win with all the elderly, babies, kids,sickly and pregnant ppl. so maybe only handful of real fights â€¦ wait are we talking death matches though? Bcz then donâ€™t want to be last man (literally) standing. 
Battle #1: Your opponent is Francis Ngannou ðŸ˜­ 
Round 30 means every opponent from then on has nukes, best of luck! 
lets get it started in here. 
We can finish faster if we choose uno 
33 if you get everybody to fight one another like dems and republicans 
ONLY 33 timesâ€¦ if itâ€™s unarmed combat, most people will be dead tired after the first few matches 
33 snaps. 
provided the rest of humanity also fights each other 
No youâ€™re 7,999,999,999 away 
if you can convince everyone else to fight eachother to the death in a 33 round bracket then yeah 
There can only be one! 
brock lesnar 
World rock, paper, scissors tournament. Winner takes all 
Or play like the Call of Duty camper. Pop out during the last battle and 3rd party snipe the winner. 
that's 32 quicksaves and maybe 96 quickloads â€‹ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  â€‹ â€‹ ..or not 
Yeah but after 20 you're left with basically the strongest majority of the population and a handfull of super lucky people that consistently got matched against old folks or kids. After 27 you don't have a chance unless you're like an MMA fighter or have single dad with adoptive kids strength 
What would be leftover to rule?
