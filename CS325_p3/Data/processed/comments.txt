that took some effort
Whoever uses the last of the roll replaces it and whenever it falls on her thereâ€™s a 50/50 chance Iâ€™ll find it like this. She swears itâ€™s by accident
That's called lying.
And being passive aggressive probably lol
When it escalates to this, shouldn't we just call it aggressive/passive?
Nah weaponized incompetence. You do it once, itâ€™s an accident. Maybe twice. At some point you notice and donâ€™t bother to fix it or purposefully do it anyway. She doesnâ€™t like changing the roll. Or she doesnâ€™t like the roll holder.
Possible solution: Get her a roll holder she adores!
This was the one I was looking for. This is terminally weaponized incompetence.
I'm morbidly curious what other habits she has, to be honest, though.
Coke
MLM
Knitting hats for animals she doesn't (yet) own
Amazing at sex.
She may or may not wake up a half hour earlier than OP and play shitty murder/mystery podcasts at full shitty Bluetooth speaker volume
And then maybe she makes fun of OP for watching normal stuff

Just reading these comments. Itâ€™s obvious why Iâ€™m alone ðŸ˜‚ I feel attacked
Or get a girlfriend you adore.
get a girlfriend we adore
Soviet anthem intensifies
Likely easier said than done
You do it once and you realize it was way harder than it should be because you were drunk and blindfolded. But you fix it. Doing this repeatedly says one of two things: Either person in question is being a hate inspiring level of passive aggressive to the point it calls into question their cognitive abilities, or they just have problems, with like problem solving, or understanding the basics of...well...anything.
Easier solution: Get a new girlfriend
The problem with that is they're already living together so he's gotta get a new girlfriend and possibly a new place to live & roommate and maybe get off the lease or wait it out.
Iâ€™d call this sunk cost fallacy depending on whether these are the only or majority of the factors keeping him around. If there are other similar behaviors that show a lack of communication skills, it might be good to reconsider despite the effort it would take to separate the living situation.
It is. And op would be better off throwing everything out.
The only people who say "NO" are people who are stuck in shitty relationships.
Bruh. It's a toilet paper roll on mildly infuriating. What's this idiotic perspective. Go out and get some friends.
Aggression with Passion
I'm a victim of similar behaviour. I'm convinced it's a response to being irritated at being told how to do it correctly. They'd rather do it wrong forever than lose face by doing as instructed.
I like to call it massive aggression.
Maybe OP always leaves a roll behind with only one usable piece which makes her do this.
Yes that would be an example of passive aggressive behavior as well as a super shitty way to communicate in a relationship.
Hey now what's wrong with communicating solely through the paper towel holder?
Sounds judgemental
When you communicate, it allows you to come up with a better solution and that is why my g/f and I found the perfect solution.
No paper towel holder and paper towel roll just sits on the microwave.
Been working for 17 years.
Or she could just be having fun.
She hasn't exactly committed a horrible offense. Lol.
Off with her head
To the guillotine
To shreds you say?!
What about his wife?
to shreds, you say?
Let her eat Kotex!
Isn't that why it's here on mildly infuriating?
It's a little annoying when you just need a paper towel, but easily fixable and not a big deal.
Thats how it starts.
Next she will accidentally put a pillow over his head as he sleeps..
First she stabs the paper towels.  Then, puts plastic bag over his head.  While holding him down, stabs him with blunt or sharp objects.  Itâ€™s classic Girlfriend 110.
What happened to Girlfriend 101 through 109? Quite an advanced class huh?
All of the 100â€™s are rudimentary courses.  No one will ever understand women.  There are courses on Girls, Girlfriends, Wives, Mothers, Ex-Wives, Ex-Girlfriends, Grandmothers, Aunts, Mother-In-Laws, Sisters, The Other Woman.  The course numbers range from 101 to 27,000.
So sorry youâ€™re new here. Everything is an intentional slight against you, your family and friends, and way of life. The only recourse OP has is to break up immediately.
Marry her first, so he can divorce her properly
Don't forget to have have a kid (or kids) with her first
Shit I forgot that step
Maybe OP always leaves a roll behind with only one usable piece which makes her do this. 
Or maybe she's just trolling
Actually, I generally prefer to be the one to change the paper roll. Same applies to the toilet paper roll in the bathrooms.
When I change them, I know that the task will get done correctly. I also know that I wonâ€™t change them with dirty hands.
Try this on for size: a careless family member goes to change the paper towel roll in the kitchen. But instead of washing the raw chicken off of their hands (with soap), they just go and touch everything including a brand new paper towel roll. 
Yum Yum, salmonella for everybody! Yay!  One of these days, a family member is going to lose a large intestine due to food poisoning. And yes, that can happen!
Ah, someone of the same species.
Happy OChristmasD!
It's a fucking war crime..don't sugar coat it
Thereâ€™s a hole in the middle for a reason
Thatâ€™s what they want you to believe
Thatâ€™s what I want to believe too
